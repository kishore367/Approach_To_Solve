Approach
The approach of the given code is to calculate the total score in a game of baseball, given an array of operations ('ops'). The code uses an ArrayList 'list' to keep track of the scores at each round.
Calculating the total score: The code iterates through the 'list' and adds up all the elements in the 'list' to get the total score, which is stored in 'ans'.

Complexity
Time complexity:
The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the 'ops' array. This is because the code only iterates through the 'ops' array once and performs a constant amount of operations for each element in the array.

Space complexity:
The space complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the 'ops' array. This is because the code uses an ArrayList 'list' to store the scores of each round, which has aNote -
The difference between '==' and '.equals()' in Java is as follows:

NOTE:
'==' operator: Compares if two references refer to the same object in memory.
'.equals()' method: Compares the values of two objects.â€‹
