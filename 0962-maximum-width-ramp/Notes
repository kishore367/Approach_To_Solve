962)Maximum Width Ramp:
Approach: 
Monotonic Stack: We traverse the array and maintain a stack of indices where the values of nums are in decreasing order
Starting from the rightmost index from Finding the Maximum Width
we pop from the stack until the top of the stack

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
