Approach :
1) Sort the Array
2) Initialize the hashmap
3) Iterate Through Numbers: For each number in the sorted list, calculate its integer square root.
4) Track the Longest Streak: Update the result with the maximum streak length found during the iteration.

Time complexity:O(nlog(n))
space complexity of O(n).
