Pick two elements at indices i and j = i + 1.
Compare them by concatenating in both possible ways (a + b and b + a).
If a + b is smaller than b + a, swap them.
Increment i and repeat until the array is sorted.

TC : O(n log n) for sort and depends on Str len o(1) else O(len(longest String));
 SC = O(n * L)
