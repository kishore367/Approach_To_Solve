Intuition
Start from base scenario and update the tree accordingly

â€‹Approach:
Base Case:
If the root is null, return null (handle empty tree).

Adding at Depth 1:
Recursive Adding at Specific Depth:
Recursively call the add method on the left and right subtrees to continue adding the row at the specified depth.

Time complexity:
O(N)
Space complexity:
O(N)
