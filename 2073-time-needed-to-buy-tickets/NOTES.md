Intuition
Brute force using loop iteration
optimised using one loop
Queue solution for more in depth

Approach
We find out min of tickets[i] and tickets[k]
Brute force approach
Time complexity: O(N^2)â€‹

Optimized approach: without extra space
Time complexity: O(N)
space complexity: O(1)

Queue approach : taking extra space
Time complexity: O(N)
space complexity: O(N)
