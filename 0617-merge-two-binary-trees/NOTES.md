Approach
we need to see for 2 conditions of total
if we use recursion to solve this problem
1 if both the tree nodes have null value at same time
2 if 1 has null while other dont
3 we have to create a new tree node for every recurcion visiting and add the value of both present roots to itâ€‹

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n) - where we visit every node once

Space complexity:O(n)
